{{!-- {{did-insert}}: This modifier is called when the element it is applied to is inserted into the DOM. 
In your code, it's calling the startSynchronization getter when the element is inserted, 
and since that getter returns a function, that function is then invoked.

{{did-update}}: This modifier is called whenever the component's arguments are updated. 
In your code, it's calling the startSynchronization getter whenever the component's arguments change, 
and again, since that getter returns a function, that function is then invoked. --}}
