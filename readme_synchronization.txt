To initiate the synchronization feature within ARENA2:

1) All instances, Main and five projectors, need to adress the same roomId and tokenId, while identiying themselves uniquely.
2) The .env should contain the IP-adress of the Main and not localhost
3) To start the bachelor's project, you need the version of the collaboration services's branch stu108573_sync-feature
4) Use the script in the ARENA2 to set up Frontend and Collaboration Service. It also provides the ExplorViz instance for the main, which is the automatically starting google chrome web browser
5) All projector instances need to be in full screen, otherwise the graphical manipulation of the software landscape is off
